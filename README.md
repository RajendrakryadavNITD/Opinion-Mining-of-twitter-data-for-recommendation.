# Opinion-Mining-of-twitter-data-for-recommendation.
The idea of project is to recommends reviews about product, person, company or other. So in this scenario we collect huge amount of data from social network (Twitter). For opinion mining of twitter data for recommendation we divide our project in three module one is language identification another is Topically clustering of twitter (text) data and last one is Opinion mining of the data. In the very first step of opinion mining of twitter (text) data our task is to identify the language of twitter data (tweets) and store data according to their category. In second step of our project is to Topical clustering of twitter (text) data. Cluster the language identified data into their relevant category or filter the data into their appropriate topic like Bollywood, sports, politics, social etc. In our final step of project ‘opinion mining’ we do sentimental analysis of topically clustered data and give reviews about person, product, company or individual, according to data available on twitter
